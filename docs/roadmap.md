# Roadmap
Not binding, the further out the less binding as I find issues through the process.

- [ ] Replication Revisit
    - [ ] Ensure the work is as expected compared to original code for bitflip and erasure
        - [ ] Bitflip
        - [ ] Bit Erasure
    - [ ] ensure the shape of the potential in time is as expected compared to original code for bitflip and erasure
        - [ ] Bitflip
        - [ ] Bit Erasure
- [ ] implement grad norm with the changes to the loss api as needed https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.02257
- [ ] add schedulers 
- [ ] Second QoL and Cleanup
    - [ ] Generalize training script, moving the more basic training tasks into a yaml-led process
    - [~] Do an api pass, making sure everything makes sense and is as easy as possible with error checking to make sure the user is doing the right thing within reason
    - [X] Optimization pass
    - [X] Do a documentation pass, docstrings, typehints, comments, etc.
    - [X] Add ability to save and load model
    - [ ] more elegent error handling for user code to better communicate where and what went wrong without crashing the entire training run if possible
- [~] add better high dimensional visualization tools


## Some stretch goals
- [ ] MVP NAND, showing 2 bits
    - [ ] Loose (01 or 10 are 1)
    - [X] Strict (11 is only 1)
- [ ] MVP 2 bit adder, showing 4 bits (01 + 01 = 10 00 as example)
- [ ] MVP 4 bit adder, showing 8 bits (0101 + 0101 = 1010 0000 as example)
- [ ] MVP 8 bit adder, showing 16 bits (01010101 + 01010101 = 10101010 00000000 as example)
- [ ] Show different potential model
    - [ ] Spline
    - [ ] Multi-layer Perceptron
