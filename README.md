# ProtocolOpt

ProtocolOpt is a library designed for optimizing time-dependent protocols in physical systems. The primary goal of this project is to provide a flexible and efficient `ProtocolOptimizer` that can train control protocols to minimize specific loss functions (such as thermodynamic work or entropy production) in stochastic simulations.

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MathiasVanPatten/protocolopt.git
cd protocolopt
```

2. Install the package in development mode (make sure your virtual environment is activated):
```bash
pip install -e .
```

3. Run the examples:
```bash
python examples/bitflip_training.py
```

4. Start the aim server to view the results in a browser:
```bash
aim up
```

## Project Overview

This library provides a modular framework for setting up and running optimization experiments. To use the `ProtocolOptimizer`, you need to define and compose the following core components:

1.  **Potential**: Defines the energy landscape of the system.
2.  **Simulator**: Handles the dynamics of the system (e.g., Euler-Maruyama for Langevin dynamics).
3.  **Loss**: Specifies the objective function to be minimized during training.
4.  **Protocol**: Represents the time-dependent control parameters that are being optimized.
5.  **InitialConditionGenerator**: Generates the starting states for the simulation.

Optionally, you may add callbacks to the `ProtocolOptimizer` to perform additional actions during the training process.
